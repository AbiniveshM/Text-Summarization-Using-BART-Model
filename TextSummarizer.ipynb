    "        Rohit Sharma, born on April 30, 1987, in Nagpur, Maharashtra, is one of the most successful and prolific batsmen of the modern era. With a humble background, Sharma’s journey to stardom was marked by difficulties and hardships. His family lived in a small single-room house in Dombivli, a suburb of Mumbai, and his father lost his job when Rohit was just 10 years old.\n",
    "Sharma made his ODI debut for India against Ireland in Belfast, scoring an unbeaten 50 against South Africa in 2007. Initially, he was a finisher, but his exceptional talent and ability to score runs consistently at the highest level soon earned him a permanent spot in the Indian top order. He is the only player to score two double centuries in One Day Internationals (ODIs) and holds the record for the highest individual score in ODIs, with 264 off 173 balls against Sri Lanka on November 13, 2014.\n",
    "Sharma’s leadership skills and strategic acumen have been instrumental in India’s success in all formats. He is the current captain of the Indian cricket team in all formats and the leader of the Mumbai Indians franchise in the Indian Premier League (IPL). His ability to motivate and inspire his teammates has been a key factor in India’s rise to the top of the ICC rankings.\n",
    "Sharma’s outstanding performances have earned him numerous accolades, including the Arjuna Award and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award, India’s highest sporting honor. His wife, Ritika Sajdeh, and daughter, Samaira Sharma, are an integral part of his life, and he has been vocal about the importance of family and work-life balance.\n",
    "Rohit Sharma’s journey from a humble background to becoming one of the most successful batsmen in the world is a testament to his hard work, dedication, and exceptional talent. As a leader, he has inspired his teammates and fans alike, and his contributions to Indian cricket will be remembered for generations to come.\n",
